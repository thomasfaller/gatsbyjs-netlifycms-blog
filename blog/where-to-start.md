Simple answer: "Here"...

Here I am, trying to figure out where to start this and setting my objectives.

The objective is to become a Front-End Developer before the end of 2017! In order to achieve this I need extensive knowledge and experience in:

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- JQUERY
- BOOTSTRAP
- ANGULAR
- NODE.JS
- ...

... Hang on, that's a lot!!

That list is not really definitive, I want to learn about most JavaScript libraries too, and some back-end technologies won't hurt (PHP, .NET, RUBY, PYTHON, etc.).

(scratching my head)

So I started to take some courses on Treehouse, Udemy, CodeSchool and FreeCodeCamp just to name a few.

I need a Portfolio Site to showcase my work, a Github account too. Some planning won't hurt!  
I decide to dedicate 1 hour every day to that new routine and I will alternate FCC, Treehouse and CodeSchool for the first 2 months.
