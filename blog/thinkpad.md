**ThinkPad** is a line of business-oriented laptop computers and [tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computers) designed, developed, marketed, and sold by [Lenovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo), and formerly [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM). ThinkPads are known for their minimalist, black, and boxy design which was initially modeled in 1990 by industrial designer [Richard Sapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sapper), based on the concept of a traditional Japanese \_[Bento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento)\_lunchbox revealing its nature only after being opened. According to later interviews with Sapper, he also characterized the simple ThinkPad form to be as elementary as a simple, black cigar box, and with similar proportions that offers a 'surprise' when opened.

The ThinkPad line was first developed at the [IBM Yamato Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Yamato_Facility) in Japan, led by [Arimasa Naitoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arimasa_Naitoh&action=edit&redlink=1), who is now dubbed the "father" of ThinkPad. The first ThinkPads were released in October 1992. Considered innovative, it became a large success for IBM during that decade.

ThinkPads are especially popular with businesses. Older models are revered by technology enthusiasts, collectors and [power users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user) due to their durable design, relatively high resale value, and abundance of aftermarket replacement parts. ThinkPads have received a somewhat [cult following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following) and a small but loyal fanbase throughout the years. Aftermarket Parts have been developed for some of these models, with custom motherboards with current processors being created for the X60 and X200. ThinkPad laptops have been used in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space) and, by 2003, were the only laptops certified for use on the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station).
